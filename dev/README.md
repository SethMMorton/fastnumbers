# Development Collateral

This file contains some files useful for development.

- `requirements.txt` - Contains the modules needed for testing.
  For use with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#example-requirements-file).
- `patch_doctest.py` -
  The [doctest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html) module
  from the Python standard library has an interesting limitation
  whereby it cannot run tests on extension modules. This file
  makes a local copy of `doctest.py` and patches it to be able to run
  on extension modules.
- `run_coverage.sh` - A small shell one-liner placed into a file that
  will compile `fastnumbers`, run all tests, then run `lcov` and
  `genhtml` to create an HTML coverage report. Only tested on OSX.
- `build.cmd` - Used to build and run tests on Windows. Shamelessly
  stolen from https://packaging.python.org/appveyor/#support-scripts.
