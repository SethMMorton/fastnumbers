Unreleased
---

[3.1.0] - 2020-11-21
---

### Added
- `query_type` function to determine what as type `fastnumbers` will interpret
  a given input

### Fixed
- Support for Python 3.9 (eliminate use of private Python C function that is now
  hidden in 3.9) (issue #43)

[3.0.0] - 2020-01-06
---

### Added
 - Support and tests for Python 3.8
 - Text to highlight that `fastnumbers` is not always faster that native Python
 - `on_fail` option that is identical to `key`, but has a more descriptive name
 - Windows testing to Travis-CI
 - Code quality checks to Travis-CI
 - Deployment from Travis-CI
 - RELEASING.md

### Changed
 - Cleaned up all test code so that it no longer includes unused code
   and also conformes to flake8/black
 - Near-complete re-write of the README, hopefully to make the functionality
   of `fastnumbers` clearer, to support better navigation, and to better
   highlight caveats.
 - Made all named options keyword-only except for `default`

### Deprecated
 - `key` function (it will forever remain allowed, but is "hidden" and cannot
   be given with `on_fail`)

### Fixed

---

### Changed
  - Speedup of conversions of ASCII-like unicode in Python 3.
  - Speedup of conversions for large integers and large floats -
    fastnumbers should now be at least as fast as built-in

  - Drop-in replacements for the built-in `int()` and `float()` functions.
  - Appveyor testing to ensure no surprises on Windows.

### Changes
  - Incorporated unit tests from Python's testing library to ensure that any
    input that Python can handle will also be handled the same way by `fastnumbers`.
  - Revamped documentation.
  - Refactored internal mechanism for assessing overflow to be faster in the most
    common cases.

### Removed
  - Dropped support for Python 2.6.

[1.0.0] - 2016-04-23
---

### Changed
  - "coerce" in `fast_real` now applies to any input, not just numeric;
    the default is now *True* instead of *False*.
  - Now all ASCII whitespace characters are stripped by fastnumbers
  - Typechecking is now more forgiving
  - fastnumbers now checks for errors when converting between numeric types
  - Testing now includes Python 2.6.

### Fixed

  - Removed `safe_*` functions (which were deprecated since version 0.3.0)

[0.7.4] - 2016-03-19
---

### Added
  - The `coerce` option to `fast_real`.

[0.7.3] - 2016-03-08
---

### Changed
  - Newline is now considered to be whitespace (for consistency with
    the builtin `float` and `int`).

---

### Fixed
  - Overflow bug in exponential parts of floats.

---

---

    that represent numbers and digits.

[0.3.0] - 2015-04-23
---

### Changed
  - Updated all unit testing to use the `hypothesis` module,
    which results in better test coverage.
  - Updated the `fast_*` functions to check if an overflow
    loss of precision has occurred, and if so fall back on the
    more accurate number conversion method.

### Deprecated
  - In response to the above change, the `safe_*` functions
    are now deprecated, and internally now use the same code as
    the `fast_*` functions.

---

### Added
  - A `default` option to the conversion functions.

    reworked to be more general... case-by-case patches should no longer
    be needed.

  - Bug where '.' was incorrectly identified as a valid
    float/int and converted to 0. This bug only applied to the `fast_*`
    and `is*` functions.

[0.1.3] - 2014-08-12
---

### Fixed
  - Bug where 'e' and 'E' were incorrectly identified as a valid
    float/int and converted to 0. This bug only applied to the `fast_*`
    and `is*` functions.

---

### Fixed
  - Bug where '+' and '-' were incorrectly identified as a valid
    float/int and converted to 0. This bug only applied to the `fast_*`
